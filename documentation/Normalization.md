# Normalization

1. First Normal Form: We checked all entities and tables had a primary key. 

2. Second Normal Form: We checked that all non key columns depend on a whole primary key. 

3. Third Normal Form: We checked that for all tables, all non-key columns only depended on primary key columns, and not any other non-key columns.

4. Boyce-Codd Normal Form: We checked that all tables had non-key columns depending on non-key columns, or key columns depending on non-key columns and there was no redundency between columns.
