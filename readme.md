# Database description

We were inspired by making cities inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable ([Goal 11] (https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/cities/)) from sustainable development goals. The main topic we address for the course project is building a public transportation database system to facilitate public transportation. In particular, we would like to create a metro database system that supports the daily maintenance operations of the metro system.
